# Telco Customer Churn - EDA &amp; Logistic Regression (made in 2021)

The data set includes information about:
- Customers who left within the last month
- Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
- Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

Customer churn is the percentage of customers that stopped using your company's product or service during a certain time frame. You can calculate churn rate by dividing the number of customers you lost during that time period - say a quarter - by the number of customers you had at the beginning of that time period.

This notebook focuses on exploring and analysing which and why customers churn and if its predictable enough to make assumptions.
